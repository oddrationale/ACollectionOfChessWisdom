# Preface

Once upon a time, there was a place called _Chessville_. It was a place built by people from all over who were united by a common interest: _"by chessplayers, for chessplayers"_ was the motto. Any visitor who happend to pass by could freely help himself to the wealth of knowledge that the community had to offer. It was almost like a chess player's paradise. But then one day, _Chessville_ disappeared from the map. It was gone, along with all of the vast library of information. Most chess players simply moved on to find other places to practice their craft; however, a few remained to try to recover some of the hidden treasures buried beneath the surface. This book is one of those items recovered and is now available again to you for the first time.

So, of course, I was being a little facetious with that story. The truth of the matter is, _Chessville.com_ was a site that has since been removed from the Internet. Thanks to the [_Wayback Machine_](http://archive.org/web/), the majority of the site is [still viewable](http://web.archive.org/web/20130124070910/http://www.chessville.com/). The site had a lot of great information for improving your chess and one of my personal favorites was a section called _A Collection of Chess Wisdom_. I decided to reprint these pages in a eBook format so that I could have access to it anywhere I go: my personal computer, phone, or tablet.

For those of you who have never read _A Collection of Chess Wisdom_, you will find within these pages principles, truisms, and general good advice on playing the game. Read and re-read these advice until they become second nature to you. Of course, not everything in this book is always true and it is not a substitute for thinking for yourself. However, I find that it is almost like a shortcut in helping me find the best move on the board.

I claim no authorship of the material presented. I have simply edited and reformatted the material from the original site. I hope you find the contents helpful when you play your next game!
