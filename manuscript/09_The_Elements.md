## Planning

J. Imbalances:
 - Superior minor piece 
 - Pawn structure
 - Space
 - Material
 - Control of key lines or squares
 - Lead in development
 - Initiative 

K. Silman Thinking Technique:
 - Figure out the positive and negative imbalances for both sides.
 - Figure out the side of the board you wish to play on. You can only play where a favorable imbalance or the possibility of creating a favorable imbalance exists.
 - Don't calculate. Instead, dream up various fantasy positions that you would like to achieve.
 - Once you find a fantasy position that makes you happy, you must figure out if you can reach it. If you find that your choice was not possible to implement, you must create another dream position that is easier to achieve.
 - Only now do you look at the candidate moves you wish to calculate.

L. Following a Plan:
 - Plans should have specific goals.
 - Plans can be offensive or defensive.
 - Plans should be based on the specific features of the position.
 - Plans are made for a few moves at a time.
 - Plans should be flexible, and modified or replaced when necessary.
 - Planning is constant - every move in a chess game should fit into a definite plan.
