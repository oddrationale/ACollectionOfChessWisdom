# General Principles and Guidelines

In chess, knowing what to do is half the battle; knowing when to do it is the other half. -Unknown

The Center - Play for the center. Occupy, guard and influence it. Drive away enemy pieces that control it.

The Initiative - White, having the first move, starts with the initiative. Don't waste time or moves. Be aggressive. Try to attack in ways that build your game. Combine defense with counterattack. Don't be afraid to gambit a pawn for an opening attack, but don't sacrifice without sound reasons. Don't waste time capturing wing pawns at the expense of development. Use the initiative to apply pressure against your opponent's position.

Development - Use all your pieces. Make only necessary pawn moves to develop pieces. Aim to develop a different piece on each turn. Move out minor pieces quickly. Castle early. Don't move the same piece twice without a good reason. Develop with threats.

Castling - Prepare to castle early in the game, especially if the center is open. Avoid moving pawns in front of your castled king and creating weaknesses there. Castle for defensive and offensive reasons - to safeguard your king and to connect & activate your rooks.

Pawns - In general, make only two pawn moves in the opening, usually the center pawns. Move them one or two squares ahead, preferably two if possible. Bad pawn moves create weak squares and unnecessary pawn moves waste time that could be better used to develop pieces. Don't block center pawns by moving bishops in front of them. Don't move pawns in front of the castled king position. Trade pawns to avoid loss of material, to open lines, or to save time.

Knights - Develop knights toward the center. White's to f3 and c3 or d2, and Black's to f6 and c6 or d7. Develop them elsewhere only if absolutely necessary or for a specific purpose. In general, you should develop knights before bishops, since it's usually much clearer early in the opening where the knights should go, but you usually have to see how the position develops to know where the bishops should go. Avoid getting knights pinned to your king or queen by bishops, and by rooks on the e or d file.

Bishops - Place bishops on open diagonals. Use them to guard center squares, pin enemy knights or defensively to break pins. Flank them if part of a plan to control squares of one color. Avoid unnecessary exchanges with knights. 

Rooks - Put them on open files, half-open files, files that are likely to be opened, or behind advanced passed pawns. Double them, so that they support each other. Use them to attack the uncastled enemy king along the e-file. Place them on the 7th rank, using them to attack pawns still on the opponent's second rank and to limit the enemy king to the back row. Use them to cut off the enemy king. In the endgame, it's often better to sacrifice a pawn and activate your rooks than to tie them down to passive defense.

The Queen - Don't move the queen out too early in the game - she is too easily attacked with tempo. Avoid developing it where it can be attacked. Don't use it if weaker pieces would suffice. Don't use the queen to go chasing pawns when it takes her away from the scene of the real action. Use it to set up multiple attacks, alone or in combination with other pieces. Don't be afraid to exchange queens to gain some type of advantage, or avoid some type of problem

Analysis - Evaluate the major elements: material, pawn structure, mobility, time, space, and king safety. Look for information about the position by asking yourself questions about each of these factors.

Planning - Plan early. Don't change plans without good reason, but be flexible. Modify your plan if desirable or necessary, as the position changes. Base your plan on a thorough and honest analysis and evaluation of the position, noting strengths and weakness for both sides, and accounting for all threats. Assess the imbalances and all other factors in the position and form your plan based on these factors.

The Endgame - Threaten to make new queens by advancing passed pawns. Force your opponent to surrender material trying to stop you. Activate the king as soon as you safely can. Trade pieces, not pawns, when ahead in material. Place rooks actively behind enemy pawns. Place them on the 7th rank. Keep them active and don't tie them down to defense. After queening a pawn, use it to force mate.
