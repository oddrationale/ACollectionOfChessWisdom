## While It Is Your Move

> "All that matters on the chessboard is good moves."
> Bobby Fischer

After each of your opponent's moves, you MUST ask yourself the following questions:

1. What has changed in the position? Every move alters the position on the chessboard, so pay careful attention to your opponent's last move. Learn to look for and recognize all changes in the position after each move, by asking the following questions:
 - Has he pinned or unpinned any of his or my pieces or pawns.
 - Are any pieces, pawns, important squares, or important lines in his or my position now unguarded, or inadequately guarded?
 - Has he created, removed, or attacked any vital guards?
 - Is the protection of weak points in his or my position still adequate?
 - Did his last move leave any pieces inadequately protected?
 - Did his last move create any pawn weaknesses?
 - Did his last move expose or restricted his king?
 - Did his last move create a vulnerable back rank?

2. What is the threat? Whatever the position, it is absolutely necessary to try to determine the purpose of your opponent's last move, even if it doesn't involve an immediate threat. Always ask yourself what is he up to and what can he do next. Always ask the following questions:
 - Was my opponent's last move a check or capture?
 - Does it threaten a check or capture on the next move?
 - Does it attack or pin any of my pawns or pieces?
 - Does it threaten to improve the position of any of his pawns or pieces?
 - Is there a positional threat (e.g., occupying an outpost, creating a battery, seizing an open line, weakening my pawn structure, creating a passed pawn, etc.)?
 - Does it prepare any long-term threats, such as a kingside attack, or remove escape squares for one of my pieces?
 - Is he concentrating his forces?

3. Tactical opportunities? After each of your opponent's moves, look for indications that a combination or tactic is available to you. Learn to look for and recognize each of the tactical weaknesses listed above under Tactical Themes. If none of these weaknesses are present, it's unlikely that a combination will exist. However, if one or more of these weaknesses do exist in your opponent's position, that's an indication that you should start looking for a combination. If so, examine each of the tactical motifs for opportunities to employ them.

4. What are the key features of the position? To answer this question, first look to see what squares each chessman on the board commands and then conduct a general reconnaissance of the board (much of this work can be done while it is the opponent's turn to move). Closely examine each of the imbalances listed above in the planning section and examine each of the following to assess how they affect the position:
 - Material: Look at all the imbalances in the amount and type of material, especially at imbalances among the minor pieces (Bishop vs. Knight and Bishops of opposite color) and imbalances in pawn majorities on either side of the board. 
 - King Position: Look at the position of both kings and whether they're secure. Evaluate their short-term prospects (secure or insecure) and their long-term prospects (positioned to help in the endgame).
 - Examine each of the positional strengths & weaknesses listed in the Positional Themes section to determine how they affect the position.
 - Determine which side, if either has a lead in development. This doesn't apply simply to the opening, but to areas of action in the middlegame also.
 - Examine the pawn structure for weaknesses.
 - Examine potential breakthrough points for both sides.

5. How can I improve my position? The essential criterion for every move, is whether it improves your position (or harms your opponent's), and promotes your own goals and objectives. If defense isn't required and no immediate tactical or attacking opportunities exist, try to improve your position in some way. Examine the list of ways to improve your position and prophylactic measures and look for opportunities to:
 - Activate dormant pieces
 - Open lines for attack
 - Seize outposts
 - Contest and seize key lines
 - Double rooks on important files
 - Post rooks on the seventh rank
 - Shift pieces toward the major attacking sector
 - Increase the scope of your pieces, especially those that are blocked or immobile
 - Increase your king's safety
 - Eliminate weaknesses from your position
 - Improve your pawn structure 

6. What is the correct plan? After a thorough analysis of the position and all its key factors, and determining what has changed and what the threats are, you must devise a plan. Examine the Silman Thinking Techniques and determine what all the imbalances and strengths & weaknesses of the position are, then decide on a short-term plan of action, based on the reality of the position, to take advantage of these factors.

7. Is this move safe? Before every contemplated move, you must ask yourself: if I make this move, will my opponent have any move which can hurt me materially or positionally, now, or in the near future? Before making your move, always ask the following questions:
 - Will my king and all my pieces and pawns be adequately defended?
 - Will my opponent have any dangerous checks or captures?
 - Will my move create any weaknesses?
 - Will I, or could I, lose material?
 - What is my opponent's best reply to my contemplated move?
 - Will it refute my move?
 - Which side will stand better after my opponent's best reply to my move?

These are the steps that you must learn to go through on every move, unless there's only one possible or plausible choice. However, in most positions, it's easy to overlook things and not always clear what the best move is. It takes time and practice, but disciplining yourself to follow these steps every time it's your move will lead to the elimination of most oversights & blunders in your play, and to increased playing strength and results.
